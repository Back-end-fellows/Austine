What is a Data Package?
A data package is a standardized schema that represents a particular type of data.
Overview
A Data Package is a pre-defined standard for the types of data that can be bought and solder using Narrative's Data Streaming Platform. 
 Data Packages create commonality between sellers of data around a particular data asset class. 
 Data Packages consist of both required and optional fields.

Required Fields
Required fields are attributes that need to be present for a data record to be considered eligible as part of a data package. 
 For the event to qualify, it must contain all of the required fields within a data package.

Optional Fields
Optional fields are attributes that may exist within a data record but are not required for a record to be considered eligible for a data package. 
 These fields may not be present on any given record within a data package, and some suppliers may never send these attributes.
